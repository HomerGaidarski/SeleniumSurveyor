# SeleniumSurveyor
Fill out a survey using selenium.

### CanesSurveyTest

1. Copy application-example.yml to src/test/resources/application-test.yml
2. Change the values to your desired settings and run the test.

NOTE: You can run the test multiple times with the same survey code and custom values, but
I don't know if it actually counts as multiple entries.
